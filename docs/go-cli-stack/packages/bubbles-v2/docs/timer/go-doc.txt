package timer // import "charm.land/bubbles/v2/timer"

Package timer provides a simple timeout component.

TYPES

type Model struct {
	// How long until the timer expires.
	Timeout time.Duration

	// How long to wait before every tick. Defaults to 1 second.
	Interval time.Duration

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Model of the timer component.

func New(timeout time.Duration, opts ...Option) Model
    New creates a new timer with the given timeout and default 1s interval.

func (m Model) ID() int
    ID returns the model's identifier. This can be used to determine if messages
    belong to this timer instance when there are multiple timers.

func (m Model) Init() tea.Cmd
    Init starts the timer.

func (m Model) Running() bool
    Running returns whether or not the timer is running. If the timer has timed
    out this will always return false.

func (m *Model) Start() tea.Cmd
    Start resumes the timer. Has no effect if the timer has timed out.

func (m *Model) Stop() tea.Cmd
    Stop pauses the timer. Has no effect if the timer has timed out.

func (m Model) Timedout() bool
    Timedout returns whether or not the timer has timed out.

func (m *Model) Toggle() tea.Cmd
    Toggle stops the timer if it's running and starts it if it's stopped.

func (m Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (Model, tea.Cmd)
    Update handles the timer tick.

func (m Model) View() string
    View of the timer component.

type Option func(*Model)
    Option is a configuration option in New. For example:

        timer := New(time.Second*10, WithInterval(5*time.Second))

func WithInterval(interval time.Duration) Option
    WithInterval is an option for setting the interval between ticks. Pass as an
    argument to New.

type StartStopMsg struct {
	ID int
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    StartStopMsg is used to start and stop the timer.

type TickMsg struct {
	// ID is the identifier of the timer that sends the message. This makes
	// it possible to determine which timer a tick belongs to when there
	// are multiple timers running.
	//
	// Note, however, that a timer will reject ticks from other timers, so
	// it's safe to flow all TickMsgs through all timers and have them still
	// behave appropriately.
	ID int

	// Timeout returns whether or not this tick is a timeout tick. You can
	// alternatively listen for TimeoutMsg.
	Timeout bool

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    TickMsg is a message that is sent on every timer tick.

type TimeoutMsg struct {
	ID int
}
    TimeoutMsg is a message that is sent once when the timer times out.

    It's a convenience message sent alongside a TickMsg with the Timeout value
    set to true.
