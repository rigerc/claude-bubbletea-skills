package help // import "charm.land/bubbles/v2/help"

Package help provides a simple help view for Bubble Tea applications.

TYPES

type KeyMap interface {
	// ShortHelp returns a slice of bindings to be displayed in the short
	// version of the help. The help bubble will render help in the order in
	// which the help items are returned here.
	ShortHelp() []key.Binding

	// FullHelp returns an extended group of help items, grouped by columns.
	// The help bubble will render the help in the order in which the help
	// items are returned here.
	FullHelp() [][]key.Binding
}
    KeyMap is a map of keybindings used to generate help. Since it's an
    interface it can be any type, though struct or a map[string][]key.Binding
    are likely candidates.

    Note that if a key is disabled (via key.Binding.SetEnabled) it will not be
    rendered in the help view, so in theory generated help should self-manage.

type Model struct {
	ShowAll bool // if true, render the "full" help menu

	ShortSeparator string
	FullSeparator  string

	// The symbol we use in the short help when help items have been truncated
	// due to width. Periods of ellipsis by default.
	Ellipsis string

	Styles Styles

	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Model contains the state of the help view.

func New() Model
    New creates a new help view with some useful defaults.

func (m Model) FullHelpView(groups [][]key.Binding) string
    FullHelpView renders help columns from a slice of key binding slices.
    Each top level slice entry renders into a column.

func (m *Model) SetWidth(w int)
    SetWidth sets the maximum width for the help view.

func (m Model) ShortHelpView(bindings []key.Binding) string
    ShortHelpView renders a single line help view from a slice of keybindings.
    If the line is longer than the maximum width it will be gracefully
    truncated, showing only as many help items as possible.

func (m Model) Update(_ tea.Msg) (Model, tea.Cmd)
    Update helps satisfy the Bubble Tea Model interface. It's a no-op.

func (m Model) View(k KeyMap) string
    View renders the help view's current state.

func (m Model) Width() int
    Width returns the maximum width for the help view.

type Styles struct {
	Ellipsis lipgloss.Style

	// Styling for the short help
	ShortKey       lipgloss.Style
	ShortDesc      lipgloss.Style
	ShortSeparator lipgloss.Style

	// Styling for the full help
	FullKey       lipgloss.Style
	FullDesc      lipgloss.Style
	FullSeparator lipgloss.Style
}
    Styles is a set of available style definitions for the Help bubble.

func DefaultDarkStyles() Styles
    DefaultDarkStyles returns a set of default styles for dark backgrounds.

func DefaultLightStyles() Styles
    DefaultLightStyles returns a set of default styles for light backgrounds.

func DefaultStyles(isDark bool) Styles
    DefaultStyles returns a set of default styles for the help bubble.
    Light or dark styles can be selected by passing true or false to the isDark
    parameter.
