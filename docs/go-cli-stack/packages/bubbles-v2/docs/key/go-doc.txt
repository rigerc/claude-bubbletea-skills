package key // import "charm.land/bubbles/v2/key"

Package key provides some types and functions for generating user-definable
keymappings useful in Bubble Tea components. There are a few different ways you
can define a keymapping with this package. Here's one example:

    type KeyMap struct {
        Up key.Binding
        Down key.Binding
    }

    var DefaultKeyMap = KeyMap{
        Up: key.NewBinding(
            key.WithKeys("k", "up"),        // actual keybindings
            key.WithHelp("↑/k", "move up"), // corresponding help text
        ),
        Down: key.NewBinding(
            key.WithKeys("j", "down"),
            key.WithHelp("↓/j", "move down"),
        ),
    }

    func (m Model) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
        switch msg := msg.(type) {
        case tea.KeyPressMsg:
            switch {
            case key.Matches(msg, DefaultKeyMap.Up):
                // The user pressed up
            case key.Matches(msg, DefaultKeyMap.Down):
                // The user pressed down
            }
        }

        // ...
    }

The help information, which is not used in the example above, can be used to
render help text for keystrokes in your views.

FUNCTIONS

func Matches[Key fmt.Stringer](k Key, b ...Binding) bool
    Matches checks if the given key matches the given bindings.


TYPES

type Binding struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Binding describes a set of keybindings and, optionally, their associated
    help text.

func NewBinding(opts ...BindingOpt) Binding
    NewBinding returns a new keybinding from a set of BindingOpt options.

func (b Binding) Enabled() bool
    Enabled returns whether or not the keybinding is enabled. Disabled
    keybindings won't be activated and won't show up in help. Keybindings are
    enabled by default.

func (b Binding) Help() Help
    Help returns the Help information for the keybinding.

func (b Binding) Keys() []string
    Keys returns the keys for the keybinding.

func (b *Binding) SetEnabled(v bool)
    SetEnabled enables or disables the keybinding.

func (b *Binding) SetHelp(key, desc string)
    SetHelp sets the help text for the keybinding.

func (b *Binding) SetKeys(keys ...string)
    SetKeys sets the keys for the keybinding.

func (b *Binding) Unbind()
    Unbind removes the keys and help from this binding, effectively nullifying
    it. This is a step beyond disabling it, since applications can enable or
    disable key bindings based on application state.

type BindingOpt func(*Binding)
    BindingOpt is an initialization option for a keybinding. It's used as an
    argument to NewBinding.

func WithDisabled() BindingOpt
    WithDisabled initializes a disabled keybinding.

func WithHelp(key, desc string) BindingOpt
    WithHelp initializes a keybinding with the given help text.

func WithKeys(keys ...string) BindingOpt
    WithKeys initializes a keybinding with the given keystrokes.

type Help struct {
	Key  string
	Desc string
}
    Help is help information for a given keybinding.
