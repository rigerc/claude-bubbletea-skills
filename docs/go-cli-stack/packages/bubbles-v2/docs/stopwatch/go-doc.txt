type ResetMsg struct {
	ID int
}
    ResetMsg is sent when the stopwatch should reset.

type StartStopMsg struct {
	ID int
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    StartStopMsg is sent when the stopwatch should start or stop.

type TickMsg struct {
	// ID is the identifier of the stopwatch that sends the message. This makes
	// it possible to determine which stopwatch a tick belongs to when there
	// are multiple stopwatches running.
	//
	// Note, however, that a stopwatch will reject ticks from other
	// stopwatches, so it's safe to flow all TickMsgs through all stopwatches
	// and have them still behave appropriately.
	ID int
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    TickMsg is a message that is sent on every timer tick.
