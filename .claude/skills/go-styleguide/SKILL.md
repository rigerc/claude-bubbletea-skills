# Go Style Guide

Based on the [Google Go Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/go).
Full reference docs are in [references/](references/).

---

## Core Principles (in priority order)

1. **Clarity** — purpose and rationale are obvious to the reader
2. **Simplicity** — accomplish goals in the simplest way possible
3. **Concision** — high signal-to-noise ratio; no repetitive or extraneous code
4. **Maintainability** — easy to change correctly; APIs that grow gracefully
5. **Consistency** — matches the surrounding codebase; consistency breaks ties

When in doubt, optimize for the reader, not the author.

---

## Formatting

- Run `gofmt` (or `goimports`). All code must be `gofmt`-formatted. No exceptions.
- No fixed line length. If a line feels too long, **refactor** rather than wrap.
- Do not split lines before indentation changes (function declarations, conditionals).
- Do not split long strings (e.g., URLs) across multiple lines.

---

## Naming

### General rules
- Use `MixedCaps` / `mixedCaps` (camel case). No `snake_case`, no `ALL_CAPS`.
- Names should be short in small scopes, longer in large scopes.
- Name based on role/meaning, not type or value.

### Packages
- Lowercase only, no underscores (e.g., `tabwriter`, not `tab_writer`).
- Avoid generic names: `util`, `helper`, `common`, `model`, `handler`.
- Do not repeat the package name in function names: `yamlconfig.Parse`, not `yamlconfig.ParseYAMLConfig`.

### Functions and methods
- Returning something → noun-like name: `Config.JobName()`
- Doing something → verb-like name: `Config.WriteTo()`
- No `Get`/`get` prefix: use `Counts()` not `GetCounts()`. Use `Compute`/`Fetch` when the call is expensive or remote.
- Do not repeat the receiver type in the method name: `WriteTo`, not `WriteConfigTo`.
- Do not repeat parameter names in the function name: `Override(dest, src)` not `OverrideFirstWithSecond`.

### Receivers
- Short (1-2 letters), abbreviation of the type: `func (c *Config)`, `func (ri *ResearchInfo)`.
- Never `this` or `self`.
- Consistent across all methods of a type.

### Constants
- `MixedCaps` like everything else: `MaxPacketSize`, not `MAX_PACKET_SIZE` or `kMaxBufferSize`.
- Name based on role, not value.

### Initialisms / Acronyms
- Keep consistent case within the initialism: `URL`, `ID`, `DB`, `HTTP`, `GRPC`.
- `urlPony` (unexported) or `URLPony` (exported), never `UrlPony`.

### Variables
- Scope-proportional length: single letter ok in tiny scopes, multi-word needed at file scope.
- Avoid shadowing well-known identifiers (`err`, `ctx`, `ok`).

---

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors. Never assign to `_` unless intentional and documented.
- Return errors as the last return value.
- Wrap errors with context: `fmt.Errorf("loading config: %w", err)`.
- Use `%w` (not `%v`) when the caller may need to `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
- Error strings are lowercase and have no trailing punctuation (they get composed).
- Sentinel errors use `errors.New`: `var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")`.
- Custom error types implement the `error` interface via `Error() string`.

```go
// Good:
if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("doing something: %w", err)
}

// Good — signal a non-obvious condition:
if err := doSomething(); err == nil { // if NO error
    // ...
}
```

---

## Packages and Imports

- Group imports: stdlib → external → internal. Use `goimports` to manage.
- Rename imports only when necessary to avoid collisions; use the same alias consistently across files.
- Avoid import cycles.
- Avoid "utility" packages that become catch-alls. Prefer focused, well-named packages.

---

## Interfaces

- Define interfaces at the point of use (consumer side), not in the package that implements them.
- Keep interfaces small. Prefer one-method interfaces.
- Do not add interfaces preemptively — only when you have multiple implementations or need to abstract for testing.
- Document what the interface guarantees, not just what it has.

---

## Testing

- Use table-driven tests for parameterized cases.
- Name test functions: `TestFoo`, `TestFoo_condition`, `BenchmarkFoo`.
- Test package naming: `package foo` (whitebox) or `package foo_test` (blackbox).
- Prefer `t.Errorf` over `t.Fatalf` unless the test truly cannot continue.
- Provide clear failure messages: `t.Errorf("Foo(%v) = %v, want %v", input, got, want)`.
- Test helper packages: append `test` to the production package name (e.g., `creditcardtest`).

```go
// Good: table-driven test
tests := []struct {
    name  string
    input string
    want  int
}{
    {"empty", "", 0},
    {"single", "a", 1},
}
for _, tt := range tests {
    t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
        got := Len(tt.input)
        if got != tt.want {
            t.Errorf("Len(%q) = %d, want %d", tt.input, got, tt.want)
        }
    })
}
```

---

## Concurrency

- Prefer channels for communicating between goroutines; prefer mutexes for protecting shared state.
- Document goroutine lifetimes. Make it clear who is responsible for stopping a goroutine.
- Use `context.Context` for cancellation and deadline propagation; pass it as the first parameter.
- Name context variable `ctx` consistently.

---

## Complexity & Abstractions

- Use the simplest mechanism sufficient: core language construct → stdlib → well-known library.
- Add complexity deliberately and document why.
- Do not add abstractions (interfaces, helper functions) until they're needed by multiple callers.
- A helper that hides critical logic makes future bugs more likely.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Don't use `=` where `:=` is needed (or vice versa) — the difference can be subtle.
- Closures capturing loop variables: capture by copy or use `t.Parallel()` patterns.
- Avoid named return values except in short functions where they aid documentation.
- Don't ignore the second return value from map lookups when the zero value is meaningful.
